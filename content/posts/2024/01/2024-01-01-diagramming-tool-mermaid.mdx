Hi folks! First of all, I'd like to wish you a Happy New Year! üéÑüéâüéä <br /> And thank AFU for having the ability to enter 2024 with you! üôè

I'd like to start this year with a post about [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) - diagramming tool that I use for projects documentation.

## Why I choose Mermaid

Back in 2023, one of my projects required to have some internal documentation in the form of diagrams. Here are requirements that I and my team had for choosing the tool:

1. We wanted to have next types of diagrams: ER diagrams, Flowcharts, Sequence diagrams, diagrams to document back-end infrastructure (e.g., relations between DBs, caches, VMs, k8s, request flow, etc.).
2. We wanted the possibility of collaborative work on the same diagram.
3. We wanted diagrams to have versions history.

We found that Mermaid covers all our requirements. Here are some pros and cons of Mermaid that I found during my work with it.

## Pros

1. As it's a code-based tool - versioning and collaborative work can be done by Git.
1. It supports all diagram types we need with detailed documentation and examples.
1. Visual part of diagrams can be customized with CSS or predefined themes.
1. It is possible to embed diagrams straight into GitHub comments or Markdown files.
1. There are plugins for two popular editors/IDEs: VS Code and Intellij which allows to preview diagrams in real-time.

## Cons

1. As it's a code-based tool - it requires some time to learn and may not fit for non-technical people that primarily work with GUIs.
1. ER diagrams with 30‚Äì40 tables are hard to read due to diagrams are rendered too wide. I'm subscribed to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/2807) and looking forward to see it fixed.
1. ER diagrams don't support regions (e.g., to group tables by modules).
1. There is no separate diagram type for documenting back-end infrastructure, but it is possible to use Flowcharts for that, [see this example](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/1227#issuecomment-1192060275).

# Summary

I'm happy with Mermaid and I'm going to use it in my future projects. I hope this post will help you to choose the right tool for your project.
