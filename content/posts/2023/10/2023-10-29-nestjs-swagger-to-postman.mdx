In this very small post we will see how to migrate your NestJS APIs to Postman with the help of NestJS Swagger package.

According to [NestJS docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction#bootstrap) - `@nestjs/swagger` allows you to download the swagger JSON config by adding `-json` to the URL. For example, if your swagger is available at `http://localhost:3000/api`, you can download the JSON config from `http://localhost:3000/api-json`:

After saving that JSON file on your drive - you can import it to a Postman collection by clicking on main menu `File -> Import`, selecting saved JSON file and clicking `Import` button:

After import is finished - you will see a new collection in your Postman:
