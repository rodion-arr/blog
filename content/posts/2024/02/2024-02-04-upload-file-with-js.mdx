Let's review how we can upload a file with JavaScript. We have next conditions:

- On the front-end - we have a single input field. On input `change` event â€” we want to upload the file to the server.
- On the back-end - we have an API endpoint that accepts a file in `file` field.

## Solution

HTML:
```html
<input type="file" id="file" name="file" />
```

JavaScript:
```javascript
document
  .getElementById("file")
  .addEventListener("change", fileUploader);

async function fileUploader(e) {
  const fileToUpload = e.target.files[0];

  // prepare multi/part form request
  const formData = new FormData();

  // fields
  formData.append("file", fileToUpload, fileToUpload.name);

  await fetch("/file-upload-api", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData,
    headers: {
      // make sure there is no `Content-Type` header - browser will set it automatically
    }
  });
}
```

## Explanation

1. We listen to the `change` event on the file input field.
2. When the event is triggered, we get the file from the input field.
3. We create a new `FormData` object and append the file to it.
4. We send a `POST` request to the server with the `FormData` object as the body.

### Why we don't set `Content-Type` header?

In the example above, we don't set the `Content-Type` header. Let's examine the POST request in DevTools.

Headers:
```http
POST /file-upload-api HTTP/1.1
...
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryV4jE7hkOAytnqefk
...
```

Payload:
```http
------WebKitFormBoundaryV4jE7hkOAytnqefk
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="wallpaper.webp"
Content-Type: image/webp
------WebKitFormBoundaryV4jE7hkOAytnqefk--
```

If we'll look on `Content-Type` header in the request, we'll see `multipart/form-data` value with MIME boundary included.

It's crucial to not set `Content-Type` header manually because it will not contain full information for the back-end server to correctly parse the request.
Browser will put boundaries automatically when sending a `FormData` object. So we don't need to set it manually.
