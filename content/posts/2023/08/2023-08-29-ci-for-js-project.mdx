In this post we will look at detailed instructions how to setup continuous integration (CI) for JavaScript project hosted on GitHub and GitHub Actions.

It is important to run static analysis and unit tests on every new portion of code changes as often and as early as possible.
So in this example we will look at how to lint and test your `Create React App (CRA)`-based project both on pull request stage and on `main` branch.

## Initial preparations

Let's create new `CRA` project:

```bash
npx create-react-app app-with-ci
```

`CRA` comes with predefined and `test` npm script but it will not run `eslint` on your code. We need to add `lint` script and make it run together with tests.

In `package.json` add 2 new lines in `"scripts"` fields:

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "pretest": "npm run lint",
  "lint": "eslint \"./src/**/*.{js,jsx}\" --quiet"
},
```

`lint` script will run `eslint` on your `js` and `jsx` files, when `pretest` script will add `lint` script to run before `npm t` command automatically.

## Create GitHub Action workflow file

In order to run out linter and tests on CI - we need to tell GitHub when and how to this operation. Let's create a new file by next path: `PROJECT_ROOT/.github/workflows/test.yml` and put there next content:

```yml
name: Test
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: npm install
        run: npm ci
      - name: npm test
        run: npm t
```

- Lines 1-6 setup workflow name and when to run it: on Pull requests and on `main` branch.
- Lines 7-18 setup 1 test job that will run on Node.js version 18.
- Lines 19-22 will install project dependencies and run `test` command on pipeline.

This workflow will prevent PR from merging in case linter or tests failed which will prevent from merging broken code to stable branches.
In the same time workflow will also run after PR merge to double check that merged code is correct together with other code from `main` branch.

## Run tests on multiple versions of Node.js

In example above we've put only one version Node.js to setup on pipeline. In case you are developing an open source package - you definitely want to run tests on multiple versions of Node.js, so you will see your tests are 'green' on all Node.js versions your package supports.

This task can be achieved by adding mode Node.js versions to `node-version` array:

```yml
node-version: [16.x, 18.x, 20.x]
```

But in the same time this will require your to spend time and periodically update this workflow to reflect all new Node.js versions through time. Definitely possible on low amount of packages but it will quickly become very time consuming manual task that can be avoided.

Let me introduce you [pkgjs/action](https://github.com/pkgjs/action) - a workflow to automatically add new versions of Node.js to your test matrix.

With `pkgjs/action` your workflow may look like this:

```yml
name: Test
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    uses: pkgjs/action/.github/workflows/node-test.yaml@v0.1
    with:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      upgrade-policy: lts
      test-command: npm test
```

It will automatically run `test` command on LTS versions defined in `engines` field of your `package.json`.
