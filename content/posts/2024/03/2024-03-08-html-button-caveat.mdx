This is a brief note for the readers to remember that the `<button>` should always have `type` attribute specified.

From my experience, I've seen a lot of cases when `<button>` elements are used without specifying the `type` attribute (mostly when used in React components). This can lead to unexpected behavior when the button is clicked.

The default type of a `<button>` element is `"submit"`. This means that if the button is inside a form, it will submit the form when clicked. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the button is not intended to submit the form.

To avoid this, always specify the `type` attribute on the `<button>` element. If the button is not intended to submit the form, use `type="button"`.

```html
<button type="button">Click me</button>
```

This will ensure that the button does not submit the form when clicked.

This behavior is documented in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button#attributes) as well.

> `type`
> <br />
> `submit`: The button submits the form data to the server. **<u>This is the default if the attribute is not specified</u>** for buttons associated with a `<form>`, or if the attribute is an empty or invalid value.

Hope this helps! ðŸš€
