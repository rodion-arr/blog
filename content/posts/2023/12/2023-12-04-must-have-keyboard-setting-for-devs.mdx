The first thing I'm doing when I get a new computer is to change keyboard settings: Repeat rate and Delay until repeat.

I'm setting them to the fastest possible values. This is especially useful when you are writing code, and you need to move the cursor around a lot.

I highly recommend you to do the same.

## MacOS

Go to `System Preferences > Keyboard` and set the values to the fastest possible for `Key repeat rate` and `Delay until repeat`.

## Windows

Go to `Control Panel > Keyboard` and set the values to the fastest possible for `Repeat delay` and `Repeat rate`.
